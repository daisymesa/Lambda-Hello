#Lambda-Hello Challenge

##My name is Daisy Mesa.

Three words to describe me are: lazy, boring, and unpunctual.

I dislike traveling, don't try new foods and restaurants, think soccer is boring, and have never heard of Netflix.

My least favorite animals are dogs - thankfully my apaprtment is too small to have a dog.  Although I dislike dogs, I think cat's are worse!  I unfortunately adopted a cat with an old roommate of mine, and decided to name it Daisy, because it sounded very much like a "pet" name.  Since my name is Daisy, when I meet someone new, I VERY frequently get "Oh my gosh, that's my dog's name!!" and take it as a compliment!
